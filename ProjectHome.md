## Description ##
This is more or less a line for line port of the opensurf project released under the 3 clause BSD license.

## Example ##
There is a simple Ant build file that you can use to run "ant example" and it should show you an example of the SURF descriptors and how well they match between two images.

## Download ##
You can either check out the code [here](http://code.google.com/p/jopensurf/source/checkout) or download the latest jar file [here](https://code.google.com/p/jopensurf/source/browse/build/jar/jopensurf.jar) "View Raw File" is what you want in the bottom right.

## opensurf ##
The original project is available at:

http://code.google.com/p/opensurf1/

This project is up to date through [revision 86](https://code.google.com/p/jopensurf/source/detail?r=86) on the trunk branch of opensurf. There are some minor differences in the trunk and dev versions that I have not included yet, but will once they become part of the trunk.

I have not yet tested this against the C# implementation of opensurf, but from a cursory look there shouldn't be any difference.
